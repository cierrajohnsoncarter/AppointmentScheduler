# AppointmentScheduler

This small python project takes a date and time, then gives those times back in 6 other timezones. This type of script can be used to figure out what time your meetings are for any intercontinental collaboration.

This was done by:
• Turning the inputted datetime into UTC
• Using a while loop and formatting to create the 6 other datetimes
